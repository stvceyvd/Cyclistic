# Case Study - How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?
### Introduction
In this case study, I will be following the steps of data analysis taught in the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics?utm_source=google&utm_medium=institutions&utm_campaign=gwgsite-gDigital-paidha-sem-bk-gen-exa-glp-br-null&_ga=2.244797261.950290879.1660862123-1096932820.1658185357&_gac=1.149812676.1658444207.Cj0KCQjw8uOWBhDXARIsAOxKJ2HwpFHSnMZDJDQv74Qkx3-MUYDeY6LNt4vm-XZ9zN0puUniH0tZM0kaAlafEALw_wcB) course -- ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act -- as a junior data analyst in the marketing analyst team for a fictional bike-share company, Cyclistic. 

### About Cyclistic 
Based in Chicago, Cyclistic is a bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to
commute to work each day.

### Scenario 
The director of marketing believes Cyclistic's future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. As part of the marketing analyst team, we need understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.

### Business Task 
Analyze Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends and better understand the differences between casual riders and annual riders, and apply these insights in new design marketing strategies. 

**Primary Stakeholders** 

- Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns
and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.

- Cyclistic executive team: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the
recommended marketing program.

**Secondary Stakeholders** 

- Cyclistic Marketing Analytics Team: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and
reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. You joined this team six months ago and have been busy
learning about Cyclistic’s mission and business goals — as well as how you, as a junior data analyst, can help Cyclistic
achieve them.
